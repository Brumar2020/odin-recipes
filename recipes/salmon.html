            <li><b>4 cups</b> rich chicken stock</li>
            <li><b>1 oz</b> dried shitake mushrooms (or 1/2 cup fresh)</li>
            <li><b>1-2 tsp</b> salt</li>
            <li><b>2</b> large eggs</li>
            <li><b>1/2 cup</b> sliced scallions</li>
            <li><b>Two 3 oz</b> packs of dried ramen noodles</li>
            <li><i><b>optional</b></i> fresh jalapeño and/or chili slices</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><i>Instructions</i></h2>
        <h4>Prepare The Chicken</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 ℉. </li>
            <li>Melt butter into skillet over medium heat and add the chicken with its skin side down. Cook until the skin is golden brown and comes off easily from the pan (5-7 minutes). Flip the chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes until golden.</li>
            <li>Transfer skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from oven and transfer to plate. Cover with foil until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Make Ramen Broth</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and ginger and cook until softened. Add soy sauce and mirin while stirring. Cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add chicken stock and cover until it starts boiling. Remove the lid and let simmer for 5 minutes uncovered. Add mushrooms, then let simmer for 10 more minutes. Season with salt and taste.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Prepare Eggs</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a pot with enough water to cover eggs and bring to a boil. Lower the eggs (straight from the fridge) into boiling water and let simmer for 7 (slightly-runny yolk) to 8 (soft but more solid yolk) minutes.</li>
            <li>While simmering, fill a large bowl with ice water. After simmering is done, put eggs into ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait 5 minutes, then peel away shell and slice egg in hald from the top. Set aside until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Putting It All Together</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop scallions and jalapeño if using. Slice the chicken into thin slices. When the eggs are done cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water</li>
            <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes or until soft and divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the chicken and ramen broth to bowls. Top with the scallions, jalapeño and soft boiled egg.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><b><i>ENJOY!!!</i></b></h4>
